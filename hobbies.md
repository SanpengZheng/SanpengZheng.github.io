## Long-Distance Running & Badminton

In order to lose weight, I have been running since 2013.
At my most frequent, I run 8 kilometers six times a week. 
But now, due to time constraints, I can only run 2-3 times a week.
Although the frequency is reduced, long-distance running really makes me feel relaxed and I love it.<br>

I started playing badminton in high school, but I didn't put much effort into it to get into college. 
When I was a graduate student, I began to learn badminton seriously organized by our laboratory, and spent 2 hours a week on the badminton court.
The competition of badminton excites me and makes me energetic. I love it.<br>
