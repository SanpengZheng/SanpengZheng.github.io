# About Me

<img src="https://sanpengzheng.github.io/SanpengZheng.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Sanpeng Zheng (郑三棚)**. I am currently a lecturer at the School of Mathematical Sciences of Guizhou Normal University (**GZNU**).

I went to the School of Mathematical Sciences at Beihang University (**BUAA**) in 2013 to pursue a **Bachelor of Science** degree and finally left as a **Doctor of Science** in June 2023.
I am very grateful for my supervisor [Prof. Renzhong Feng](https://math.buaa.edu.cn/szdw1/azcck/js/frz.htm "个人主页") and the school.
I choose to return to my hometown (Guizhou province) and start my independent academic career in **GZNU**.

My current research interest is <font color='red'>the fitting and approximation on high-dimensional data</font> and <font color='red'>scattered data approximation</font>. 
I welcome scholars at home and abroad to exchange and discuss with me on issues in those fields.
Interested students are also welcome to contact me and make progress together.
